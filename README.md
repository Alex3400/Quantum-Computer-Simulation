# Quantum-Computer-Simulation

This is my Quantum Computer Simulation made in python use to replicate results about security of the BB84 algorithm.

This code was written during the summer of 2023 (May,June&July) and was uploaded here in November of 2023

This code was written in collaboration with Dr.Po-Heng Lee at Imperial College London

Here is an example of the tests that were run to provide statistical evidence about security of BB84

Here is the Qiskit output of an example tests with randomized bits, and interference.
